# ppr-getter

Currently working on: Motions and Music

### Usage:
- Rename music list into music_list.txt
- edit ppr.py 
    - allowFileChanges - to copy files automatically or not in the out directory
    - convertdir - path/to/assetbundle/convert
- run ppr.py with ppr.py <motionlist.json> or just ppr.py and it will prompt for the json file.
- out directory will be created. Inside is the music name if available and the motion files

### Todo (if ever):
- Support for model data
- [for models] Info on dresses (Currently have info on head IDs)
- Auto-Export?
